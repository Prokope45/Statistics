The questions are on lec2.pdf. 
Submit your answer to the homework questions as a class with class name homework. 
In the class, define the following two constants and two functions:

Constants:
hw_a     A dictionary to give your answer to part a).
hw_b     A Pandas data frame to give your answer to part b).

Functions:
hw_ab_fun  A function to get answer for part a) and b).
           It has one argument file_name: a file name (such as 'hw1_1.txt').
           Return your answer to part a) and the extracted Pandas data frame for part b). 
           This function will be tested on input files similar to hw1_1.txt but different content. 

findmin  A function with three input arguments (it, v, df), where df is a data frame 
           having column names same as the data frame in part b). 
           Return the smallest log10Ubeta2sum

You can start with the template hw2_answer_template.py. After filling in your answer, submit hw2_answer_template.py and hw1_1.txt to gradescope homework 2. 

Your submitted code will be tested on a practice data set (the given data set) and two test data sets. 
Your code will be called in the following way:

from hw_answer_template import  homework as ans
myanswer = ans()
myanswer.hw_a
myanswer.hw_b
myanswer.hw_ab_fun(filename) # where filename is a string of file name such as 'hw1_1_dat.txt'
myanswer.findmin(it, v, df  )
