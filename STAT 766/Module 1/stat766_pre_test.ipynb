    "**Purpose:** This pre-test is designed to gauge your readiness in the core areas of *background knowledge on modeling*, *programming* and *practical implementation* skills that are crucial for a modern machine learning course. The goal is to identify areas where you might need to review *before* the course begins, ensuring your success. Please answer all questions to the best of your ability.\n",

First, I look at the error message to see if it is a simple mistake. Second, I find the line where the error is raised, and try to backtrack of why that error might be raised, such as mal-formed input or improperly used functions.</p>\n",
